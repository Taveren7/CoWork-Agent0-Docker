# Operations Rules (edit to match your shop)

- Never delete files unless explicitly instructed.
- Use versioned filenames for outputs.
- Prefer Excel output first, PDF second.
- Any reorder/PO logic must be documented in the run log.
- If vendor mapping is missing, create a TODO list in the log and proceed with what you can.
